# ðŸ”º Welcome to my first calculator using Python! ðŸ”º


Hi! I'm learning python, so my first project was this console calculator!

# What can you do? âž•âž–âž—âœ–
The first thing is that you can make the console save your name to have a better user experience. You can also choose what type of basic mathematical operations you want to do, the result is immediately thrown at you. Supports floats.
In addition to that when the operation is finished you can start over without executing the .py command at the end of each operation.

# Skills

You can look at my code to base yourself and practice a little Python, so you see the functionalities that this great programming language has. Remember to do projects with everything you learn to better understand the language.


# Thank you.
